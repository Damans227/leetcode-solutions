| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |--------------|
| Longest Substring without</br> repeating characters  | Given a string s, find the length of the longest</br> substring without repeating characters.  | Use a sliding window with hashset. If the new chracter is in the hashset, slide the left index until it is not in the set anymore. Otherwise, add it to the hashset and keep sliding right. | Sliding window | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IETreEybaA |
| 55. Jump Game | Given an array of non-negative integers </br>nums, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. Determine if you are able to reach the last index.  |Use back tracking, and check if you can reach index 0 from last index  | Backtracking | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb4eRjuPHbM |
| 66. Plus One  | Given a non-empty array of decimal digits representing a non-negative integer, increment one to the integer. | Use back tracking with a for loop to add one to a digit less than 9 and then create a new array if all digits are 9| Back tracking  |https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKjt0f1N0GA |
| 20. Valid Parentheses | Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.| Stack and Linear Iterate | Iterate through the String and use stack to push() Open Bracket and Pop() Close Bracket.  | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kmUaXrjizQ |
| 1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses  | Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string. |Balance String L-R and then R->L and remove extra closed bracket  | Balance String | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sClFsx12VgM |
| 5. Longest Palindromic Substring  | Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s. |Start from the mid and expand two seperate pointers to left and right | mid to end expansion| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK5OKKbF6GI|
| 415. Add Strings  | Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string  | 1_ Make use of ASCII '0' character to get indivual digit in the INTEGER form | Start from the end of 2 numbers | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qp-CTzat50|
| 680. Valid Palindrome II | Given a string s, return true if the s can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it. |Use 2 pointer method from start to end, and use ahelper function to skip the non matching chars | 2 pointer and helper function | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_74qbyPHXE |
| 14. Longest Common Prefix | Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.| Take one string, and compare it char by char with every other string  | Brute Force | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQmI7F9dJ0|
| 443. String Compression | Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm. | Start 2 pointers at the beginning and keep updating a counter whenever you hit a different character | 2 pointers/ Sliding window ??| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhJgguNiYYk |
| 1108. Defanging an IP Address  | Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.  |Use String Builder, brute force  | Linear Solution |https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJTgBNT3LbA |
| 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary  | n an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order |Create a character mapping of new alphabets order  | ASCII substraction | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvachM5i6-Q|
